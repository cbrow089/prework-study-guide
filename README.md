# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This project was intended to illustrate the topics I learned in the prework section of this course and to implement them into a webpage using each type of code explored in prework modules.  It is a way for bootcamp students to look back and utilize it as a makeshift overview of what we learned in each section.  It allows the user to quickly see each topic and to also randomly select one to look at first if viewed through the console in Google DevTools.  This project taught me how to focus on being organized and how to use the git flow to help create and maintain an on going project.


## Installation

"N/A"

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide is a resource that details out what I learned during the prework modules that contains notes about each section for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.  If you open the DevTools console in Google Chrome you can see the JavaScript code running for the page.  It will list out all the different topics we learned and even choose randomly a topic to study first.
